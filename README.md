#Binary Tree Search

### Description

This is a project I completed for my "Data Structures and Algorithms in C" class at Sheridan College. This is a console application that allows you to enter 10 strings which are entered into a binary tree and then allows you to search for one of the entered strings. If the string if found you will recieve a success message.


### Features
- Store 10 strings in a binary tree
- Search for one of the entered strings
- Basic error validation
